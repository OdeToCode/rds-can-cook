title: Orecchiette con cime di rapa (Home-made pasta with broccoli rabe)
category: main courses
shortdescription: Broccoli rabe, or rapini, is a bitter green that comes into season in autumn. This is a traditional dish from Apulia, in southern Italy. Itâ€™s earthy and rustic, a peasant-style main course typical of a family lunch.
ingredients:
    Orecchiette (home-made pasta in the shape of small shells).
    1 bunch broccoli rabe, roughly chopped, for each 500g of pasta.
    3 table spoons of extra-vergin olive oil.
    1 garlic clove, finely sliced.
    1 small red chilli, chopped (optional).
    50g of pancetta (Italian bacon), cut into batons.
    A few basil leaves, crushed to a paste with 1 tea spoon of olive oil.
    A pinch of Mediterranean sea salt.
    A grind of black pepper.
    Grated pecorino (sheep milk seasoned cheese) at wish.
directions:
    Boil water in a pot, and when boiling, add orecchiette, broccoli rabe and sea salt.
    Stir with love.
    Cook until the orecchiette are "al dente". And I mean it.
    Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a frying pan and add garlic, chilli and pancetta.
    Fry over medium heat for 1 minute, then add the basil paste and season the mix with salt and pepper.
    Drain orecchiette and broccoli rabe, add them to the pan and coat with the fried sauce.
    Add parsley and grated pecorino to taste.
    Toss briefly, then remove from the heat and serve.
    Enjoy!
