title: Oliebollen (Dutch deep fried dumplings)
category: sweets
shortdescription: Oliebollen are traditionally eaten on New Year's Eve and at funfairs. In wintertime, they are also sold in the street at mobile stalls. Many families have their own recipe for generations.
ingredients: Ingredients for 20 oliebollen
- 1 apple in small pieces
- zest of 1 lemon
- 200 gr raisins
- 500 gr flour
- 1 bag of dried yeast (7 gr)
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 egg, clutched
- 500 ml butter milk
- oil for frying (sunflower oil works well)
- powder sugar for decoration
directions:
1. Mix the apple pieces, lemon zest and raisins with 1 tablespoon of flour. In a separate bowl, mix the rest of the flour with the yeast, sugar and salt. Pour the egg in the middle of the mix. While mixing with a hand mixer, gently add the butter milk and keep mixing until the batter is smooth. Lightly mix the apple-raisin mix with the batter. Cover the bowl with a wet dish towel and let the batter rise for one hour in a warm and draft free place. The volume should double.

2. Cover a colander with paper towel. Heat the oil in a frying pan. Use two spoons or an ice-scoop spoon to get batter from the bowl and let it flow in the oil (it helps if you briefly dip the spoon in the hot oil before getting the batter from the bowl). Fry the oliebollen for around 5 minutes, maximum 5 oliebollen at a time. If the oliebollen don't turn by themselves, use a spatula or spoon to turn them in the oil. Use a slotted spoon to get the oliebollen out of the oil and let them dry in the colander. Repeat this process until you run out of batter.

3. Place the oliebollen on a large plate and cover them with powder sugar. Enjoy!
