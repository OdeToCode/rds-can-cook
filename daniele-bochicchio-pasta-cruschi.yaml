title: Cavatelli mollicati con peperoni cruschi (Home-made pasta with breadcrumbs and sun-dried red peppers)
category: main courses
shortdescription: Cruschi (pronounced croosky) are a typical taste of Basilicata, southern Italy: prepared in the Summer, those are sun-dried red peppers, that can last for years in a fresh environment (no fridge needed).
Quickly fried in olive oil, they combine the crunch of potato crisps with the sweetness of peppers (no chilli peppers are allowed).
ingredients: For 4 people
    Cavatelli (Italian home-made pasta)
    4-5 cruschi
    4-5 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil
    1 garlic clove, finely sliced
    4-5 tablespoons of breadcrumbs (the oldest the bread the better)
    Pepper and sea salt as needed
directions:
    Fry the breadcrumbs in olive oil (in a frying pan), with pepper and garlic. Stop when the breadcrumbs start to become brown.
    Quickly fry the cruschi in olive oil for 15 seconds (in a separate pan). It's really 15 seconds, otherwise, these will lose their crunchiness
    Boil water in a pot. When water is boiling, add your pasta (remember the sea salt!). Wait for the minutes that come with your pasta (or just wait a couple of minutes in case of home-made pasta). In Italy, it's al dente or nothing.
    When the pasta is al dente, drain it.
    Mix the breadcrumbs, cruschi and pasta in a separate bowl.
    Serve to your friends and enjoy a little bit of southern Italy!
