title: Fresh Artisan Bread - easy every day family recipe 
category: side dishes
shortdescription: You can make fresh, crusty, artisan bread every night with this recipe - and it's easy! This recipe takes 5 minutes to prepare the dough, and 35 minutes to cook after it rises. Make every gathering special with some fresh bread! This recipe comes the Bustamante / Guerrero family (thank you Gabi and Carlos!) who have been in the wheat mill business for generations - so they know bread and taught me well!
ingredients: For 4-6 people
    White Flour (3 1/2 cups)
    Water (1 1/2 cups)
    Quick rise yeast (1 packet)
    Sugar (one pinch)
    Salt (3/4 tablespoon)
    Additional cooking water (1 cup - for steam)
directions:
    Get a medium size plastic bowl and put 1 1/2 cups of lukewarm water. Add the yeast and sugar and mix it. The sugar helps the yeast rise faster.
    In another bowl put the flour and mix with the salt. 
    Mix the flour mixture into the water. This is best done by hand without a lot of kneading, however, if you have a mixer you can use it with the dough hook and it takes just a few minutes to mix it all together. 
    Place the dough in a bowl, cover with a kitchen towel lightly over the top of the bowl. 
    Let it rise at least 3 hours, overnight is better. It may get crusty overnight, and this is even better!
    When ready to bake, take the dough out the a floured surface and roughly shape into a flat rectangle, then fold it to a loaf shape.
    You can make a single, larger loaf, or break it into two smaller sticks.
    Pre-heat the oven to 425 with an empty cookie sheet in the bottom rack.
    Put the bread onto an oiled cookie sheet (if you have two smaller loafs they should both fit).
    Just before you put the sheet into the oven, use a sharp knife to make diagonal cuts into the loaf. 
    Pour the additional cookie water into the bottom pan for steam (this makes the bread crust crunchy) and place the sheet with the loaf(s) on the middle rack.
    Bake for 35 minutes. 
    Take the bread from the oven and place it on a rack to cool. 
    Cut and serve warm! Great with butter, foie gras, charcuterie, sausage, or just by itself! A really fun activity with your kids!
    For a slight variation, replace 1/3 of the white flour with wheat flour, and just before putting the break in the oven baste the top of the loaf with beer (yes, beer, thanks Carlos Andres :)) and sprinkle some oats for decoration.
