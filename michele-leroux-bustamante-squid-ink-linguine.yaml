title: Squid Ink Linguine with Shrimp
category: main courses
shortdescription: This adaptation of various pasta dishes I've learned to cook through the years is one of my favorites with the hint of spice, lemon and light sauce of tomato, garlic and white wine. It's also pretty easy to make so always a fast favorite with accidental dinner parties!
